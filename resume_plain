Education
Double Major in Computer Science and Physics
The University of Berkeley at California, Berkeley, CA

Technical Skills
• Python: Over 3 years of experience, used this language for both small tools and large projects Java Currently learning this language in class, designed and implemented data structures
• TEX 5: years of experience, typeset over 50 documents of various lengths
• Scheme: Written an interpreter for a subset of Scheme, have a good understanding of how it works Javascript Used Javascript to create a web-based Scheme interpreter
• Emacs: I do all my text editing with a highly customized version of Emacs
• Assembly: Familiar with how CPUs work and how to program them

Selected Projects
• Building a Computer from Scratch https://github.com/yuanchenyang/My-EOCS
Following the instructions from a book called the Elements of Computing Systems, I built a CPU from logic gates using a hardware simulator. Then I proceeded to create an assembler for the CPU and a VM simulator that takes in VM code (similar to java bytecode) and outputs assembly code.

• Online SICP Textbook http://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/1-1-elements.html
Made an interactive version of the classic Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book with my friend. I created the multithreaded Javascript-based Scheme interpreter.

• Logic Gate Simulator https://github.com/yuanchenyang/Logic-Simulator
Used Python to create a logic gate simulation system with constraint passing. This system also allows powerful abstractions to be made so that more complicated sets of gates can be created, saved and reused. This project won an honorable mention in the Facebook Battle of the Bay hackathon.

• Perfect Strategy for Hog https://github.com/yuanchenyang/Hog-Perfect-Strategy
For a project in my CS class, we have to create artificial intelligence agents to compete in a dice game called Hog. I used dynamic programming and recursion to create a prefect strategy that cannot be beaten, thereby winning the contest.

Teaching:
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, John Denero, Paul Hilfinger, (Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2014)
  - Besides teaching discussion sections, labs and holding office hours, I participated in building infrastructure for the class such as autograder and website development, as well as content development such as creating labs, homeworks and project questions.

* Discrete Math and Probability, Umesh Vazirani, (Spring 2015)
  - I taught discussions and was on the content team responsible for creating homeworks, discussion worksheets and solutions.

* Designing Information Devices and Systems, Anant Sahai and Ali Niknejad (Fall 2015)
  - I taught a discussion section and participated heavily in content development, creating homework and discussion questions. I also helped to write numerous lecture notes from scratch.

Research Projects:

* Synthesis of a Layout Engine (Advisor: Ras Bodik) Spring 2014 -- Fall 2014
  - Helped built a compiler which synthesizes a layout engine in Rust from a CSS specification, which replaces the hand-written layout engine in the experimental browser Servo.

* Attacks on Mobility as a Service Networks (Advisor: Alex Bayen) Summer 2015 -- Fall 2015
  - Used queueing theory to develop a model for investigating attacks on mobility as a service systems, formulated and solved for optimal attacks, and ran experiments using a dataset of 1B NYC taxi trips.

* Locality-Sensitive Hashing for Matching Paths (Advisors: Alexei Pozdnoukhov, Alex Bayen) Spring 2015 -- Present
  - Construct and analyze locality-sensitive hashing schemes to match two paths in Euclidean space. This has applications for transportation researchers, who wants to group together GPS traces of people taking the same route.

* Quantifying Impact of Routing Services (Advisors: Alexei Pozdnoukhov, Alex Bayen) Fall 2015 -- Present
  - Studied the effects of real-time routing services on traffic networks with a routing game framework.
