% Projects
\header{Selected Projects}

\begin{body}
  \vspace{14pt}

  \textbf{Facebook Group Archiver} \hfill \url{http://archiver.chenyang.co}\\
  A tool for saving Facebook groups in a local database and doing comprehensive searches locally. After the first download, it will sync the local database with the Facebook group during each run. Also includes a web-interface for stats, searching and doing database queries. \\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Interactive SICP Textbook} \hfill \url{http://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/1-1-elements.html}\\
  Made an interactive version of the classic Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book with my friend. I created the asynchronous Javascript-based Scheme interpreter used on the website.\\
  \medskip

  \textbf{WebGL Particle Simulator} \hfill \url{http://www.chenyang.co/particles}\\
  A simulation with thousands of particles attracted by gravity, created with WebGL and Javascript. \\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Python Control Flow Visualizer} \hfill \url{http://pyvisualizer.chenyang.co}\\
  An online tool that run python programs and visualize the code branching using D3.js\\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Scheme on TI-89} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/TI89-Scheme}\\
  Built a Scheme interpreter from scratch that runs on my TI-89 graphing calculator. It is written in C and supports a small subset of the Scheme language.\\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Building a Computer from Scratch} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/My-EOCS}\\
  Following the instructions from a book called the Elements of Computing Systems, I built a CPU from logic gates using a hardware simulator. Then I proceeded to create an assembler for the CPU and a VM simulator that takes in VM code (similar to java bytecode) and outputs assembly code. \\
  \medskip

  % \textbf{Logic Gate Simulator} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/Logic-Simulator}\\
  % Used Python to create a logic gate simulation system with constraint passing. This system also allows powerful abstractions to be made so that more complicated sets of gates can be created, saved and reused. This project won an honorable mention in the Facebook Battle of the Bay hackathon.\\
  % \medskip

  % \textbf{Perfect Strategy for Hog} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/Hog-Perfect-Strategy}\\
  % For a project in my CS class, we have to create artificial intelligence agents to compete in a dice game called Hog. I used dynamic programming and recursion to create a prefect strategy that cannot be beaten, thereby winning the contest. \\
