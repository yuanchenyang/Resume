  \textbf{Undergraduate Student Researcher (Prof Alex Bayen)}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Spring 2015 -- Present}\\
  \vspace*{-5pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
  \item Helped develop and implement algorithms for inferring route flows of
    traffic from cellular data.
  \item Used queueing theory to develop a model for investigating attacks on
    mobility as a service systems, formulated and solved for optimal attacks,
    and ran experiments using a dataset of 1B NYC taxi trips.
  \item Studied the effects of real-time routing services on traffic with a
    routing game framework.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Undergraduate Student Researcher (Prof Ras Bodik)}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Spring 2014 -- Fall 2014}\\
  \vspace*{-5pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
  \item Helped built a compiler which synthesizes a layout engine in Rust from a
    CSS specification, which replaces the hand-written layout engine in the
    experimental browser Servo.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Undergraduate Student Instructor}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Fall 2013 -- Fall 2015}\\
  \vspace*{-5pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items

% Projects
\header{Programming Projects}

\begin{body}
  \vspace{14pt}

  \textbf{Linear Algrbra DSL} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/llvm-linear-algebra-dsl} \\
  An open-ended project for a compilers class. First created a set of tools for
  building domain specific languages (DSLs) using LLVM for code generation and
  created a DSL for linear algebra operations with domain-specific
  optimizations. Then implemented an edge detector and an optical flow
  estimation algorithm using the DSL.  \medskip

  \textbf{Facebook Group Archiver} \hfill \url{http://archiver.chenyang.co}\\
  A tool for saving Facebook groups in a local database and doing comprehensive
  searches locally. After the first download, it will sync the local database
  with the Facebook group during each run. Also includes a web-interface for
  stats, searching and doing database queries. \\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Interactive SICP Textbook} \hfill
  \url{http://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/1-1-elements.html}\\
  Made an interactive version of the classic Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs book with my friend. I created the asynchronous
  Javascript-based Scheme interpreter used on the website. \\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Self-Balancing Robot} \hfill \url{http://youtu.be/Ps0Ex3ADR6k} \\
  An open-ended project for my physics electronics lab class, built a
  self-balancing robot from scratch. Programmed a controller for it on an
  Arduino board. \\
