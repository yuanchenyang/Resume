  \textbf{Undergraduate Student Researcher}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Spring 2015 -- Present}\\
  \vspace*{-4pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
  \item I work on traffic research with Professor Alex Bayen. One project I'm
    working on is inferring route flows of cars from cellular connection
    data. Another project I'm working on involves using queueing theory to
    investigate possible attacks on on-demand taxi networks by calling taxies
    and then canceling the calls.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Undergraduate Student Researcher}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Spring 2014 -- Fall 2014}\\
  \vspace*{-4pt}
  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt  % reduce space between items
  \item I worked with Professor Ras Bodik on the synthesis of a layout engine
    for an experimental browser, Servo. I helped built a backend which generates
    a layout engine in Rust, which replaces the hand-written layout engine in
    Servo.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{TA for Discrete Math and Probability}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Spring 2015}\\

  \textbf{TA for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs}, \emph{UC Berkeley} \hfill \emph{Fall 2013 -- Fall 2014}\\

  \textbf{Software Engineering Intern}, \emph{Clover} \hfill \emph{July--August 2013}\\

% Projects
\header{Selected Projects}

\begin{body}
  \vspace{14pt}

  \textbf{Linear Algrbra DSL} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/llvm-linear-algebra-dsl} \\
  An open-ended project for a compilers class. First created a set of tools for
  building domain specific languages (DSLs) using LLVM for code generation and
  created a DSL for linear algebra operations introducing lots of
  domain-specific optimizations. Then implemented an edge detector and part of
  an optical flow estimation algorithm using the DSL.
  \medskip

  \textbf{Facebook Group Archiver} \hfill \url{http://archiver.chenyang.co}\\
  A tool for saving Facebook groups in a local database and doing comprehensive
  searches locally. After the first download, it will sync the local database
  with the Facebook group during each run. Also includes a web-interface for
  stats, searching and doing database queries. \\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Interactive SICP Textbook} \hfill
  \url{http://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/1-1-elements.html}\\
  Made an interactive version of the classic Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs book with my friend. I created the asynchronous
  Javascript-based Scheme interpreter used on the website. \\
  \medskip

  \textbf{Self-Balancing Robot} \hfill \url{http://youtu.be/Ps0Ex3ADR6k} \\
  An open-ended project for my physics electronics lab class, built a
  self-balancing robot from scratch. Programmed a controller for it on an
  Arduino board. \\
