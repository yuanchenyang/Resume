\begin{body}
  \vspace{14pt}

  \textbf{Synthesis of a Layout Engine}, \emph{Advisor: Ras Bodik} \hfill \emph{Spring 2014 -- Fall 2014}\\
  Helped built a compiler which synthesizes a layout engine in Rust from a CSS
  specification, which replaces the hand-written layout engine in the
  experimental browser Servo.

  \textbf{Attacks on Mobility as a Service Networks}, \emph{Advisor: Alex Bayen} \hfill \emph{Summer 2015 -- Fall 2015}\\
  Used queueing theory to develop a model for investigating attacks on mobility
  as a service systems, formulated and solved for optimal attacks, and ran
  experiments using a dataset of 1B NYC taxi trips.

  \textbf{Locality-Sensitive Hashing for Matching Paths}, \emph{Advisors: Alexei Pozdnoukhov, Alex Bayen} \hfill \emph{Spring 2015 -- Present}\\
  Construct and analyze locality-sensitive hashing schemes to match two paths in
  Euclidean space. This has applications for transportation researchers, who
  wants to group together GPS traces of people taking the same route.

  \textbf{Quantifying Impact of Routing Services}, \emph{Advisors: Alexei Pozdnoukhov, Alex Bayen} \hfill \emph{Fall 2015 -- Present}\\
  Studied the effects of real-time routing services on traffic networks with a routing
  game framework.

  \textbf{Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs}, \emph{John Denero, Paul Hilfinger} \hfill \emph{Fall 2013, Spring 2014, Fall 2014}\\
  Besides teaching discussion sections, labs and holding office hours, I
  participated in building infrastructure for the class such as autograder and
  website development, as well as content development such as creating labs,
  homeworks and project questions.

  \textbf{Discrete Math and Probability}, \emph{Umesh Vazirani} \hfill \emph{Spring 2015}\\
  I taught discussions and was on the content team responsible for creating
  homeworks, discussion worksheets and solutions.

  \textbf{Designing Information Devices and Systems}, \emph{Anant Sahai, Ali Niknejad} \hfill \emph{Fall 2015}\\
  I taught a discussion section and participated heavily in content development,
  creating homework and discussion questions. I also helped to write numerous
  lecture notes from scratch.

\begin{body}
  \vspace{14pt}

  \textbf{Linear Algebra DSL} \hfill \url{https://github.com/yuanchenyang/llvm-linear-algebra-dsl} \\
  An open-ended project for a compilers class. First created a set of tools for
  building domain specific languages (DSLs) using LLVM for code generation and
  created a DSL for linear algebra operations with domain-specific
  optimizations. Then implemented an edge detector and an optical flow
  estimation algorithm using the DSL.  \medskip

  \textbf{Self-Balancing Robot} \hfill \url{http://youtu.be/Ps0Ex3ADR6k} \\
  An open-ended project for my physics electronics lab class, built a
  self-balancing robot from scratch. Programmed a controller for it on an
  Arduino board. \\
